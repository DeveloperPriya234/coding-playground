//what is string in js?
//!String is a primitive data type in JavaScript that represents a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created, their values cannot be changed. However, you can create new strings based on existing ones using various string methods.

//Creating strings?
//!You can create strings in JavaScript using single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or backticks (` `) for template literals


let str1 = "Hello, World!🐦‍🔥"; // double quotes

let str2 = 'JavaScript is fun!🚀'; // single quotes

let str3 = `Template literals allow for multi-line strings and interpolation: ${str1}`; // backticks

let str4 = new String("String object"); // using String constructor
